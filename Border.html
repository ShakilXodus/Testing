    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>
        "Fools" said I, "You do not know.
        Silence like a cancer grows.
        Hear my words that I might teach you.
        Take my arms that I might reach you"
    </p>

<div class="disect">
    <h2>Section 2</h2>

    <p>
        But my words, like silent raindrops fell.
        And echoed in the wells of silence
    </p>
